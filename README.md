# Renaissance

This is a 1.11.2 fork based on the origin Renaissance. The code here is very unpolished, and not very well done. If you see some code you think could be written better please don't say it's bad, I know it is, make a pull request. 

Building Renaissance no longer requires Strukkit, but Strukkit features have been removed.

### Building

Before building, have a 1.11.2_R1 Craftbukkit jar placed into a folder call `lib` in the root directory. 

Once the Craftbukkit jar is placed, use `mvn clean package` to build Renaissance.
